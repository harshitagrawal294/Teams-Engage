# Microsoft Teams- Prototype 

## Overview:

The project aims to make a web application for audio and video conferencing among participants. 

Work Flow:

1. User goes to the website and is prompted for room code
2. If the room doesn't exist already, a new room with given code is created and user is notified about the same
3. Another user goes to the website and enters the same code.
4. User joins the already existing room and is notified about same.
5. The first user who created the room is notified that another user has joined the room.
6. Users can create as many rooms as they like. Rooms are isolated from each other.
7. Each room can have maximum of two participants at a time. If the room is already full, the participant will be notified about the same.
8. User can click on switch room to create or join another room. The user will leave the first room on clicking switch room.
9. Closing the browser tab will make the user automatically leave the room.
10. Only the other participant in same room is notified about remote user leaving/joining the conference. Participants in other rooms are not disturbed.
11. If the camera is engaged somewhere else (say for some other meet), then the user will be notified about the same and will prompted to close the same.
